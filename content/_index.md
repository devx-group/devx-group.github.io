- Design and implementation of visual programming environments
- Languages and their environments with mixed notations
- Abstraction engineering
- Methods to support working with abstractions, such as example-based programming, omniscient debugging, etc. 
- Input and output devices for interacting with programming environments
- Infrastructures, meta-tools and framework for tool implementation/creation

The activity of the working group takes the form of <.... to be decided ....>, as well as a dedicated session at the French software engineering days organized by the CNRS GDR GPL.
